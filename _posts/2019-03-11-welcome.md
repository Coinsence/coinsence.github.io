Welcome to the new [Coinsence](http://coinsence.org/) blog! 

We're excited to finally have a blog to share our journey building the Coinsence platform. 

A lot of things have happened in the last weeks, for example: our full-time team is growing significantly, 
we got funding from the UNICEF Innovation Fund, new features have been released and are in development 
and we have great talks with new partners - just to name a few! 

All those news we will post here, so stay tuned.
